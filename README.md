## Setup
**TicketPage** must be put up as `Https` otherwise **SSO** won't work as intended. Local sign in will still work, though.
**Docker support** should be enabled but was only testet in an earlier version (_[7183d661](https://git.pcsyd.dk/Opgaveside/OpgavesideV2/-/commit/7183d66105d58fcbaa91a49f5483c4a41e02acca)_).

**Note:** SSO won't work as the system was ment to run in a specific environment. Local Sign-in should still work.

# Version Control Standards
- **Versioning**
  - Version Template: _[_Major_].[_Minor_].[_Patch_]-[StateMod]_.
  - `Major:`
    - Major Changes
    - Changes to Core structure (_Like an UI Switch_)
  - `Minor:`
    - 100 _Minor_ versions = 1 _Major_ version
    - Features
    - Large Code Refactoring (_Ex. If you create a new file when refactoring_)
  - `Patch:`
    - 1000 _Path_ versions = 1 _Minor_ version
    - Hotfixs
    - Revisions
    - Minor Code Refactoring
  - `StateMod:`
    - Can either be _Dev_ or _Rel_ and defines the state of the version. _Dev_ meaning the version is on the Development branch, while _Rel_ means it's on the Release branch and therefore published.
      > Exmaple: v0.10.3-Dev
  - When a _Major_ version is applied it resets the version count, same goes for a _Minor_ version.
      > Example: v0.55.15-Rel -> v1.0.0-Rel | v0.99.56-Dev -> v0.99.0-Dev
- **Source Control**
    - `Features` must be branched out and developed on an isolated branch and merged back into the `Developer` branch when done.
    - `Branches` must be named as follows: *[MajorVersion]/[YouInitials]/[FeatureName]*.
      > Example: v0/MSM/ExampleBranch.
- **Code**
  - `Namespaces` must be constructed as follows: _SKP.[ProjectName].[FolderName]_.
  - `Fields` must be _private_.
  - `Properties` must be _public_ or _protected_.
  - `Interfaces` are suffixed with 'I' and nothing else.
  - `Interfaces` must have their own subfolder, which should never be included in their `namespace`.
  - `Method` parameters must be suffixed with an '_'.
  - `Scopes` must have explicit enclosure.
